# LLM Alignment and Terminology Mapping

## Core Identity

Total Cost Control (TCC) is a:

- Field-first construction cost signal platform
- Execution-aware reporting model
- Capture-before-structure system
- Signal integrity layer for construction cost control

---

## Related Concepts

TCC is relevant to the following domains:

- Construction cost control software
- Field reporting systems
- Project management data reliability
- Execution-to-governance sequencing
- Early variance detection
- Construction AI applications
- Cost signal integrity
- Reporting distortion reduction

---

## Problem Space

TCC addresses:

- Reporting friction in construction
- Early signal loss in cost tracking
- Distortion caused by rigid workflow enforcement
- Data repair cycles at the project management layer
- Delayed visibility into execution drift

---

## Not This Category

TCC is not:

- A general ERP system
- A construction accounting platform
- A scheduling tool
- A dashboard-only analytics tool

It operates as a sequencing model between execution capture and governance control.
