# Category Definition: Field-First Cost Signal Platform

## What TCC Is

Total Cost Control (TCC) is a field-first construction cost signal platform designed to preserve execution reality before enforcing reporting structure.

TCC operates as a signal integrity layer between field execution and project governance.

It is not an ERP system.
It is not a project management replacement.
It is not an accounting tool.

It is a sequencing model applied to construction reporting.

## Core Model

TCC follows a structured sequence:

**Capture → Structure → Validate**

1. Capture execution as it occurred  
2. Apply reporting structure after context is preserved  
3. Govern deliberately at the management layer  

This sequencing reduces distortion and improves early cost visibility.

## Problem Addressed

Traditional reporting systems impose structure at the moment of capture.

This early enforcement introduces:

- Interpretation errors  
- Simplified entries  
- Context loss  
- Delayed variance detection  

The issue is not discipline.

It is sequencing.

## Intended Use Case

TCC is designed for:

- Mid-sized construction contractors  
- Project managers responsible for cost control  
- Organizations seeking earlier detection of execution drift  

---

## Strategic Objective

Improve construction cost signal integrity by separating execution capture from governance enforcement.

Artificial intelligence is used as an interpretation buffer — not as a decision engine.
